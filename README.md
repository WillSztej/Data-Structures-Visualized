# Data-Structures-Visualized
Program to visualize common data structures

The idea behind this project is to develop an interactive learning application that visualizes complex data 
structures and algorithms. A very similar example would be something like the website visualgo.net. This concept
is not entirely new, but an implementation of such would be helpful to solidify my own understanding of certain 
algorithms and data structures.
